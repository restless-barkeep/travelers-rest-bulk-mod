Here are DrStalker's tips on downloading/installing mods which is how I figured out these mods above.

## Downloading the mod

Mods are available on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/travellersrest) or you can download/recompile the mod from my github repo


## How to install mods:

* Install [Bepinex](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.2)﻿ (Stable version 5.4 for Windows 64; the filename will look like `BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.2.zip`)
* Start the game, quit the game after it finishes loading
* This will create a Bepinex config file and a plugins folder that you can put additional mods in
* (optional) Enable the Bepinex Console (see the detailed guide or the Bepinex documentation for steps)
* Copy the mod .dll to the plugins directory.


## How to change mod settings:

* Install the mod and start the game.
* Bepinex will create a file in the \BepInEx\config\ with default settings for the mod.
* Exit the game, edit the config file, restart the game.


## Is this mod save to add/remove mid play-through?

Yes.
