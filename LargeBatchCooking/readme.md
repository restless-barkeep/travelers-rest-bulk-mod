# Large Batch Cooking

Need to bake a lot of bread before heading out to chop trees and don't want to have to come back ever 35 in game minutes? With this mod hold ModTrigger (RightClick/Sprint/L3 or other editableKey) while entering the crafter and all recipes will be increase by an modifiable amount (default: 5). This increases time/ingredient/fuel cost and output.

- Default now always resets recipes back after closing the crafter (unless the modKey is held on exit)
- The batch size multiplier can be adjusted (default to 5)
- The craft time being multiplied is now toggle able (defaults to false as otherwise a recipe can go on to following day and losing the bonuses) [ sorry TubaAssassin your corn will be missed ]


- Controllers and Keyboards can also use the configurable button inplace of Run/RightClick.


to have even larger batches keep the ModTrigger held and open close the crafter each reopen will increment the craft amount
- so 5x -> 10x -> 15x -> ...
- to reset the recipe to normal exit the crafter without holding ModTrigger.
