Genn — 02/25/2024 2:06 AM
Two things... 1) Kinda the wrong channel. 😛 2) That won't happen, because the capacity of your kegs and taps is planned to be upgradeable. If the bartender could just restock them their capacity would be essentially infinite, thus making those upgrades pointless.

devoutburrito told me to post these here! 

Few things I thought would make quality of the game a bit more immersive. It would be nice if the travelers/visitors talked about things happening around the area. 

Like "Did you hear about the miner stuck in the ice?" "Poor fella, frozen solid" 

"Did you see the giant rock man?" "Heard he has a chicken for a hat" 

"I wonder what the nice family south of here sells?" 

"Did you see that lass at the beach?"

 "Some creepy guy wanted to sell me a bird" 

Stuff like that would be great hints for exploring and other "tips"

May your hair grow grey!

To food, friends, and fire!

They all say "nice to get into the warm", but since the seasons update, that doesn't make sense for half the year. 
I propose the following for the different seasons.

Spring: "The wind is brutal out there", "Glad to be out of the wind"
Summer: "Nice to out of the sun", "At least it's cool in here"
Fall: "I saw a specter on the road!", "Do you think this place has ghosts?" (for Halloween event)
Winter: "The snow's up to my knees!", "Thank gods for that fire"

Some other alternatives could be:

" I came for the grub, i stayed for the pub"

I also have one for the laughs:
"The food is so good, it's almost worth surviving the dragon attack on the way here" 
Or to shorten it maybe go with:
"Hope food's worth the dragon attack"
You could swap out dragon attack with a bunch of things like goblin ambush/raid or troll attack

I'm having a lot of fun coming up with lines. Would be really amazing to get one in the game ha ha

"Stop taking food from my plate!"

I'm quite tired of accused of being a cultists and would like a few more rumors added. Also, I think it would be cool if the text was gray or smaller when people share rumors to show they're whispering.
 "Heard the lad/lass who runs this place was a bandit"
"Wait'll you hear what I heard about the barkeep....."
"I heard the owner here is runaway royalty!"
"Wasn't this place built on a grave yard?"

"Aye, That's the good stuff"
"Reminds me of Mum's cooking"
"Almost of good as me wife's cooking"
"This must be what old Rygar's place was like"
"This place puts old Amos's to shame!"

"Thank gods it's open!"
"Buck up lads, we're almost there"
"I'll be glad to sleep in my own bed again"
"Nearly home now"
