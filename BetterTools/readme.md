# BetterTools

Until the Devs add better tiers of tools here is a collection of tool improvements based on TavernLevel

## Ax/Pick
- Have a MAX_LEVEL to denote when tool is now STEEL and can 1 hit Trees/Rocks

## Hoe/Spade/WateringCan
- Have a MAX_LEVEL and MAX_ROWS to denote when tool is now STEEL and can optionally till/dig/water MAX_ROWS at once with ModTrigger (RightClick/L3).

With MAX_ROWS = 6

Hoe/Spade: default base tool does 1 tile, Modded with ModKey Copper 2, Iron 4, Steel 6
