## EndlessLateNights

The clock will go from 2:55am to 1:55am forever causing an endless night.

## FasterFueling

Need to put 100 fuel into a Crafter but don't want to click multiple times now just hold right click while left clicking and 5x the fuel will be pulled from inventory to Crafter.

## LargeBatchCooking

Needing to bake more bread but don't want to babysit the crafter to refill as much? Can now do larger batches (defaults to x5 recipe holding right click when entering the crafter will change the recipes)

## QuickWaterWell

Just brewed 100 stouts? well time to press refill water buckets 100 times, but now it is just Once! (while holding right click)

## SkipFishingMod

Can't handle the fishing mini game like me? well here is DrStalkers no fishing mod shamelessly borrowed from here https://github.com/DrStalker/TravellersRest-EasyFishing.




Speaking of shamelessly stolen code here is DrStalker's tips on downloading/installing mods which is how I figured out these mods above.

## Downloading the mod

Adding Traveller's Rest to Nexus Mods is in progress, until that is complete you can download the mod from [compiled-releases](https://github.com/DrStalker/TravellersRest-BetterClock/tree/main/compiled-releases)

## How to install mods:

* Install [Bepinex](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.2)﻿ (Stable version 5.4 for Windows 64; the filename will look like `BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.2.zip`)
* Start the game, quit the game after it finishes loading
* This will create a Bepinex config file and a plugins folder that you can put additional mods in
* (optional) Enable the Bepinex Console (see the detailed guide or the Bepinex documentation for steps)
* Copy the mod .dll to the plugins directory.


## How to change mod settings:

* Install the mod and start the game.
* Bepinex will create a file in the \BepInEx\config\ with default settings for the mod.
* Exit the game, edit the config file, restart the game.


## Is this mod save to add/remove mid play-through?

Yes.
